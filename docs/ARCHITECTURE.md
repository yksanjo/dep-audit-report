# Architecture

## Domain

Supply Chain Security

## Core Components

1. Input/API boundary with schema checks
2. Core policy/risk evaluation engine
3. Persistence or reporting adapter layer
4. Alerting/logging and operator feedback path
5. Testable deterministic domain functions

## Engineering Priorities

- Deterministic decisions for compliance/security actions
- Explicit error handling and safe defaults
- Isolated core logic for unit-level validation
